=========================
Phase 4b: **Mesa-native driving** — inverting time ownership.

In examples 01-05 the year loop lives inside ``engine.run()``. Here the loop is
owned by a small model that advances one tick at a time via ``model.step()``,
mirroring the native DYNAMO-M ``SLRModel.run_model()``. The decision science is
unchanged; only *who drives time* changes.

What you learn here
-------------------
* the object graph mirrors DYNAMO-M: ``FloodAdaptSLRModel -> Agents ->
  CoastalNodePopulation`` (households) -> shared ``DecisionRule``,
* ``model.step()`` advances exactly one year; ``model.run_model()`` is the tick
  loop,
* ``run_mesa_native(...)`` is a drop-in analogue of ``engine.run(...)`` and
  produces **bit-for-bit identical** results (the Phase-4b gate),
* the ``DecisionRule`` seam is what makes this time-ownership migration
  non-breaking (and paves the way to the native honeybees ``model.step()``).
