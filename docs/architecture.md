# FloodAdapt-ABM x DYNAMO-M Coupling - Architecture, Phases & Technical Reference

**Status:** Canonical, standalone architecture document (merges the former
`coupling_architecture.md` deep reference and the `proposed_architecture_all_phases`
development/roadmap record into one).
**Audience:** developers and reviewers who need the full picture - purpose, MVP
scope, target architecture, the coupling contract, the complete SEU decision
science and math, UML/sequence/data-flow diagrams, a worked walkthrough, every
delivered phase (0 -> 4b-full), engine performance, issues & resolutions, and the
Phase-5 roadmap.

This file is organised in two parts:

- **Part I - Development architecture, phases & progress** - the narrative and
  roadmap view: what the coupling is, how it is structured, what has been
  delivered phase by phase (including **Phase 4b-full**), and what remains.
- **Part II - Technical reference** - the formal deep dive: bridge signatures,
  the full SEU mathematical formulation, UML/sequence/data-flow diagrams, the
  step-by-step numeric walkthrough, and the I/O contracts.

**Companion tracked docs** (kept in lock-step):

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) - operational guide (data requirements, NetCDF schema,
  gotchas, phase history, engine performance contract).
- [`../floodadapt_abm_documentation.md`](../floodadapt_abm_documentation.md) -
  whole-repo API reference (every module, function and dataclass, with examples).
- [`adaptation_decisions_complete.md`](adaptation_decisions_complete.md) - the
  DYNAMO-M decision-science reference (source of the ported SEU logic).

Per-day design docs and frozen per-phase model documentation are retained locally
under `docs/progress/` and `docs/archive/` for traceability (not required reading).

# Part I - Development architecture, phases & progress

## 1. Project purpose & repositories

Two repositories collaborate to answer one research question: *how do policy
incentives and lived flood experience shape household-level adaptation, and hence
long-term coastal flood risk, under sea-level rise (SLR)?*

| Repository | Role | Key artefacts |
|---|---|---|
| **FloodAdapt-ABM** | Lightweight Monte-Carlo simulation engine. Turns a precomputed FloodAdapt (SFINCS+FIAT) impact lookup table into building-level damage time series and adaptation decisions under an SLR scenario. | `setup_lookup_table.py` (stage 1), `simulation_engine.py`, `decision_rule.py`, `_core/dynamo_decision_bridge.py`, `_core/lookup_utils.py`, `mesa_native.py`, `coastal_node_adapter.py`, `examples_engine/`, `tests/` |
| **DYNAMO-M** | Global honeybees/Mesa-style ABM of coastal household migration & adaptation. Supplies the Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) decision science that replaces FloodAdapt-ABM's naive rule. | `decision_module.py`, `agents/coastal_nodes.py`, `hazards/flooding/flood_risk.py`, `settings.yml`, `docs/adaptation_decisions_complete.md` |

The two stages of FloodAdapt-ABM share **exactly one interface**: the NetCDF lookup
table (dims `object_id × slr × strategy × event`; vars `total_damage`, `inun_depth`;
attrs `max_pot_dmg`, `freq`, `primary_object_type`). This clean seam is the backbone
of the whole coupling and must remain stable.

## 2. Objective & MVP scope

The Minimum Viable Product replaces FloodAdapt-ABM's simple reactive rule
("if `damage/max_pot_dmg > 0.3` then floodproof") with DYNAMO-M's SEU household
decision framework, while **keeping** FloodAdapt-ABM's own elevation assumption
(an adapted household's damages are read from the `floodproof_all_0` strategy in the
lookup table).

- **IN:** households = residential buildings only (substring `'RES'`); dry flood-proofing vs do-nothing; SEU with CRRA utility, exceedance-curve integration, risk-perception decay, affordability cap, loan amortisation, adaptation lifespan (75 y).
- **OUT (Phase 5+):** insurance (`calcEU_insure`), migration + gravity model, government/dike CBA agent, population/GDP dynamics, variable floodproof height.
- **BYPASSED by design:** DYNAMO-M's internal hazard physics (`interpolate_water_levels`, dike overtopping, GLOFRIS scaling). All flood depths and damages come from the SFINCS/FIAT lookup table.

**Hard requirement (`coupling_architecture.md` Sec.1.3):** for the SEU exceedance
integral to be valid, the stage-1 EventSet should be a true return-period set
(e.g. `[2,5,10,25,50,100,250,500,1000]` yr). If a non-RP set is used, a per-household
damage-sorted exceedance curve must be derived first.

## 3. Target architecture (Strategy Pattern) — delivered & frozen

The endorsed resolution (proposed 2026-07-07/08, delivered in Phases 2–3) is a single
`SimulationEngine` that owns time + data, with a fully pluggable `DecisionRule`.
`ABMSimulator` and `DynamoDecisionBridge` remain as thin backwards-compatible layers.

```text
SimulationEngine (owns time + data)            FloodAdaptSLRModel (Phase 4b: owns time via ticks)
  ├── NetCDF loading / interpolation             ├── engine: SimulationEngine (shared kernel)

  │     └── per-(SLR, method) interp cache         │
  ├── Stochastic event draw (Bernoulli + cap)    └── agents → CoastalNodePopulation → step()
  ├── AgentState (wealth, income, risk_perception,
  │              flood_timer, is_adapted, time_adapted)
  ├── run(no_seq, n_jobs) — parallel Monte-Carlo sequences (bit-identical)

        ├── ThresholdRule   (legacy 0.3 rule)
        ├── SEURule         (ported DYNAMO-M SEU — MVP default)
        ├── DynamoLiveRule  (native DYNAMO-M — parity oracle, Phase 4a)
        └── <custom>        (Open/Closed: new science = new rule)
```

### 3.1 The `DecisionRule` interface (stateless, vectorised, NumPy-first)

```python
class DecisionRule:
    def __init__(self, config: DecisionConfig):   # r, sigma, loan_duration,
        ...                                        # expenditure_cap, amenity_weight, lifespan_dryproof, ...
    def should_adapt(self,
        agent_state: AgentState,      # wealth, income, risk_perception, flood_timer,
                                      #   is_adapted, time_adapted
        damages_no_adapt: np.ndarray, # (n_agents, n_events)  full catalog @ SLR_t, no measures
        damages_adapt: np.ndarray,    # (n_agents, n_events)  full catalog @ SLR_t, floodproofed
        event_freqs: np.ndarray,      # (n_events,)  exceedance probs (= 1/RP)
        max_pot_dmg: np.ndarray,      # (n_agents,)
        adaptation_costs: np.ndarray, # (n_agents,)  annualised loan repayment
    ) -> np.ndarray:                  # (n_agents,) bool
        ...
```

The signature was deliberately **widened** versus the 2026-07-07 draft so that
`DynamoLiveRule` is pluggable: (1) `AgentState` carries `risk_perception` (DYNAMO-M's
`calcEU_*` consume it directly); (2) the rule receives *both* per-event damage
matrices at the current SLR (no-adapt and adapt), because the SEU is *ex-ante* and each
`calcEU_*` integrates a full exceedance curve; (3) `adaptation_costs` (annualised loan
repayment) is passed explicitly; (4) decision parameters are injected once via the
constructor from `DecisionConfig`. `ThresholdRule` ignores the extra arguments, so
backward compatibility is preserved.

### 3.2 What got unified

| Concern | Before | After (delivered) |
|---|---|---|
| Damage interpolation | 2 implementations | one `lookup_utils` kernel, called by the engine |
| Event drawing | `ABMSimulator` + inline example code | one method in `SimulationEngine` / `event_utils` (Bernoulli + **random** pool cap) |
| State tracking | 2 separate array sets | one standardised `AgentState` container |
| Year loop | nested loops / manual demo loop | single `run()` / `step()` in the engine |
| Decision logic | hardcoded in classes | pluggable `DecisionRule` |

### 3.3 Design principles enforced

- **Single Responsibility:** the engine owns time & data; the rule owns behaviour. No FloodAdapt or DYNAMO-M imports inside the rule kernels.
- **Open/Closed:** new science (insurance, migration, live DYNAMO-M) arrives as a new `DecisionRule`, not by editing the engine.
- **Backward compatibility:** `ThresholdRule` reproduces legacy `ABMSimulator` results bit-for-bit so existing notebooks keep working.
- **Vectorisation & JIT:** `_iterate_through_flood` stays `@njit`-able; no per-household Python loops in hot paths.

## 4. Connection & coupling design (one timestep)

Per `(sequence, year)` the engine performs the following; the **REPLACED** block is
the only decision-specific part and is delegated to the rule via the stable
`DecisionRule.should_adapt(...)` seam.

```text
1. year_events = sequences[s][t]                      # Bernoulli draw + random cap
2. prepare damages @ SLR_t (cubic/linear via lookup_utils):
     D_no = damage_matrix_no_measures[:, :, t]        # (n_hh, n_events)
     D_fp = damage_matrix_floodproof[:, :, t]
3. realised = where(is_adapted, D_fp, D_no) over occurring events
   total    = sum_events(realised);  was_flooded = total > 0
   --- REPLACED (decision rule) ---------------------------------------
4. update_flood_experience(was_flooded)               # flood_timer, risk_perception decay
5. adapt = rule.should_adapt(state, D_no, D_fp, freqs, max_pot_dmg, costs)
     SEURule: EU_do_nothing = ∫ U(NPV_no_action(p)) dp
              EU_adapt      = ∫ U(NPV_dryproof(p) − cost) dp   (affordability inside)
              adapt = (EU_adapt > EU_do_nothing) & ~is_adapted
     lifespan reset: time_adapted ≥ 75 → un-adapt & re-decide
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
6. is_adapted |= adapt;  time_adapted bookkeeping
7. store damage_history[s,:,t], adapted[s,:,t]
```

**Coupling contract (must stay stable across refactors):**

| Direction | Payload | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| ABM → rule | `expected_damages_no_adapt` / `_adapt` @ SLR_t | `(n_events, n_hh)` |
| ABM → rule | `p_floods` (= `freq` = 1/RP) | `(n_events,)` |
| ABM → rule | `property_value` (`max_pot_dmg`) | `(n_hh,)` |
| ABM → rule | `is_adapted`, `time_adapted`, `was_flooded` | `(n_hh,)` |
| rule → ABM | `adapt_decision` | `(n_hh,)` bool |
| rule → ABM | `risk_perception`, `EU_adapt`, `EU_do_nothing` (diagnostics) | `(n_hh,)` |

Time is driven natively — first by `SimulationEngine.run()`/`step()`, and ultimately
by DYNAMO-M's Mesa `model.step()` cycle (Phase 4b). Keeping the rule interface stable
is what makes the migration non-breaking and preserves the long-term reverse-coupling
vision (DYNAMO-M consuming external flood damages).

## 5. SEU decision science (concise)

The ported `SEURule` reproduces DYNAMO-M's household SEU. Full derivation and symbols
are in **Part II** (below) Sec.4; the essentials:

- **Expected utility of *do nothing*** (`calcEU_do_nothing`): integrate CRRA utility of
  the net-present-value wealth path over the perceived flood exceedance curve. Adapted
  agents return −∞ in the no-nothing branch (they already hold the measure).
- **Expected utility of *dry flood-proofing*** (`calcEU_adapt`): same integral on the
  `floodproof_all_0` damage curve minus the annualised loan cost; **affordability is
  encoded as `EU_adapt = −∞`** when unaffordable (never re-checked downstream, to avoid
  logic drift).
- **Decision:** `adapt = (EU_adapt > EU_do_nothing) & ~is_adapted`.
- **Risk perception** decays over time since the last flood (`flood_timer`), bounded by
  `risk_perc_max`; a flood resets the timer and raises perception.
- **Adaptation lifespan:** floodproofing has a finite life (`lifespan_dryproof = 75 y`).
  When `time_adapted ≥ lifespan_dryproof` the agent un-adapts and re-decides — reproducing
  DYNAMO-M's multi-generational turnover (native source: `coastal_nodes.py:2221–2227`).
- **`p_floods` contract:** both live methods `np.sort(p_floods)` ascending, cap perceived
  probability at 0.998, and integrate (`trapezoid`) over `[0,1]` — hence the RP-EventSet
  requirement (Sec.2) is mandatory for the SEU/live rules.

## 6. Decision rules & phase model-documentation

| Rule | Behaviour | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `SEURule` *(default)* | ported DYNAMO-M SEU (ex-ante EU maximisation, CRRA utility, risk-perception decay, affordability cap, loan amortisation, 75-y lifespan reset) | the validated MVP science |
| `ThresholdRule` | legacy ex-post rule: adapt when `damage/max_pot_dmg > 0.3` | backward compat; reproduces `ABMSimulator` bit-for-bit |
| `DynamoLiveRule` | calls the **native** DYNAMO-M `DecisionModule` (optional, guarded via `DYNAMO_M_PATH`) | parity oracle — proves the port hasn't drifted |
| `<custom>` | subclass `DecisionRule`, implement `should_adapt(...)` | new science without engine surgery (`examples_engine/03_custom_rule.py`) |

### 6.1 Phase 4a — `DynamoLiveRule` (live parity oracle)

A thin adapter that imports DYNAMO-M's `DecisionModule` and calls `calcEU_adapt` /
`calcEU_do_nothing` with the same arrays the bridge assembles. Verified feasible in
source: those methods are near-pure array functions (depend only on the `@njit`
`IterateThroughFlood` and `self.error_terms_stay`, not on `self.model`/`self.agents`),
so **no full Mesa model is required**. Obstacles handled: (1) the module-level
`gravity_models` import is guarded as an **optional** dependency; (2) a minimal stub model
supplies `settings`/`random_module`/`args`; (3) for bit-parity, `error_interval=0`
(`error_terms_stay=1`), aligned RNG, `amenity_value=0`. **Gate PASS:** decisions identical
across 5 configs; worst EU abs diff 1.9e-6, rel 4.8e-7 (tol abs ≤1e-3, rel ≤1e-4).

### 6.2 Phase 4b — Mesa-native driving (scaffold)

Phase 4b inverts *who owns time*. A small `FloodAdaptSLRModel` advances one tick at a
time via `model.step()`, mirroring native DYNAMO-M `SLRModel.run_model()`
(`while True: self.step()`). The object graph mirrors DYNAMO-M
(`FloodAdaptSLRModel → Agents → CoastalNodePopulation → DecisionRule`); the decision
science is untouched — the same `DecisionRule.should_adapt` seam is called from a
different driver. **Gate PASS:** `run_mesa_native == engine.run` bit-for-bit across
5 cases (SEURule ×3, ThresholdRule ×2).

### 6.3 Phase 4b-full — native-class integration (DELIVERED)

Phase 4b-full binds the **real honeybees `Model`** as the time-owning base class and
routes each year's decision through the **native DYNAMO-M `DecisionModule`** — the
documented final integration step. It is delivered as `mesa_native_full.py` and gated
bit-for-bit (see Sec.6.3.1 for the adapter it builds on).

- `FloodAdaptSLRModelFull(honeybees.model.Model)` — genuinely subclasses the real
  framework `Model`, so the clock (`current_time` / `current_timestep` / `end_time`) is
  owned by honeybees exactly as the upstream `SLRModel` is. `AgentsFull` /
  `CoastalNodePopulationFull` mirror the native `Agents` / `CoastalNode` object graph.
- The coastal-node population is fed **entirely from the FloodAdapt lookup table** via the
  PRE.4 `LookupTableAdapter` (forward `populate` each tick; reverse `write_back` each
  tick) — no GLOFRIS, gravity models, geojson or low-memory paging.
- Decisions run through the native `DecisionModule.calcEU_*` (via `DynamoLiveRule`); the
  driver also works with the ported `SEURule`/`ThresholdRule` when DYNAMO-M is absent.
- **Guarded**: honeybees is imported defensively (`HONEYBEES_AVAILABLE`; construction
  raises `HoneybeesNotAvailable` otherwise), so the package still imports without it.
- **Gate (triple bit-parity):** `run_mesa_native_full == run_mesa_native == engine.run`,
  element-wise, across seeds/sequences for `SEURule` and `ThresholdRule`. Verified end to
  end, including a run on the **real ~58k-household Charleston table** and native-vs-ported
  EU parity (EU_adapt max |abs| ≈ 2.9e-6). See `examples_engine/07_mesa_native_full.py`
  and `verification/mesa_native_full/`. **+22 tests** (`tests/test_mesa_native_full.py`).

Because the honeybees `Model` owns only the clock while every numeric per-year operation
is still delegated to the shared `SimulationEngine.step` kernel with the identical RNG
stream, swapping the framework-free 4b scaffold for the genuine framework is provably
non-breaking.

#### 6.3.1 The lookup-table → CoastalNode adapter (PRE.4)

The adapter is the one genuinely new modelling artefact for 4b-full. Delivered as a
standalone, contract-tested prototype (`coastal_node_adapter.py`) and now driven every
tick by 4b-full:

- `CoastalNodeArrays` — native node-array mirror: `property_value`, events-first
  `damages_coastal_cells`, `p_floods`, `adapt`, `time_adapt`, `_flood_plain` geom_id.
- `LookupTableAdapter.populate()` (forward) / `write_back()` (reverse, with object_id
  alignment guards) / `round_trip_check()` (executable bit-parity contract).
- 10 tests including an end-to-end proof that routing state through the node is a
  simulation no-op.

### 6.4 Phase 4b-pre — the shared-engine staleness guard (PRE.3)

`FloodAdaptSLRModel.__init__` calls `engine.reset_state()` on a *shared* engine; a second
model would silently invalidate the first model's live `agents.regions.state` view. Fixed
with `SimulationEngine.state_epoch` + `FloodAdaptSLRModel._check_not_stale()`: stepping a
stale model now raises `RuntimeError` instead of corrupting state. Bit-parity gate
unaffected (`run_mesa_native` constructs models sequentially). +4 tests.

## 7. Completed phases & steps

| Phase | What was done | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Stabilise** | Fixed the `cfg.environment.max_slr` demo crash; reconciled `DecisionConfig` docstring vs defaults; green examples. | Demos run; suite passes |
| **1 — Validate SEU** | Ran the `coupling_architecture.md` Sec.12.1 battery (degenerate risk perception → baseline; adoption vs 0.3-threshold; sensitivity sweeps; affordability → zero adoption; lifespan turnover). Cross-checked ported SEU vs native `calcEU_*`. | Battery passes; SEU == DYNAMO-M within tol (worst rel EU 4.2e-7) |
| **2 — Consolidate event & time** | Moved Bernoulli draw + cap into the core with **random** pool selection; native `run()`/`step()`; hardened `read_impacts_dataset` with an `object_id`-indexed accessor. | No decision logic in example scripts; ThresholdRule regression exact |
| **3 — SimulationEngine + rules** | Built `SimulationEngine`, `AgentState`, `DecisionRule` ABC; ported `ThresholdRule`/`SEURule`; added `eu_history`, `is_residential`; **implemented `time_adapted` + `lifespan_dryproof=75` reset**. | ThresholdRule reproduces legacy output; battery re-passes |
| **4a — Live parity** | `DynamoLiveRule` parity oracle (Sec.6.1). | PASS (worst EU abs 1.9e-6, rel 4.8e-7) |
| **4b — Mesa-native (scaffold)** | Time-ownership inversion via `FloodAdaptSLRModel.step()` (Sec.6.2). | PASS (5/5 bit-for-bit) |
| **4b-pre — De-risking & hygiene** | PRE.1 (pin mesa 3.3.1 / honeybees 1.2.0, import/instantiate DYNAMO-M) · PRE.2 (**real-table gate**, Sec.9) · PRE.3 (staleness guard, Sec.6.4) · PRE.4 (adapter prototype, Sec.6.3.1) · HYG.1–4 (README rewrite, path purge + vendored `verification/`, **CI**, engine notebook + Markdown design docs) · VER.1–2 (battery re-run + figures). | All PRE/HYG/VER closed; **125 tests PASS**; CI green |
| **4b-full — Native-class integration** | Bound the real honeybees `Model` (`mesa_native_full.py`) + native `DecisionModule`; population fed from the lookup table via the PRE.4 adapter; example 07 + full verification battery (Sec.6.3). | **PASS** — triple bit-parity across seeds/sequences; real-table run; **+22 tests → 147 PASS** |

## 8. Current state assessment (2026-07-09)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-1 lookup table (`setup_lookup_table.py`) | Done / stable | Unchanged by the coupling. EventSet must be RP-based. |
| Unified `SimulationEngine` + `DecisionRule` (Phases 2+3) | **Done, gated** | `ThresholdRule` reproduces legacy output bit-for-bit; `SEURule` matches the Phase-1 battery; lifespan-dryproof reset implemented and unit-tested. |
| Phase 4a — `DynamoLiveRule` parity oracle | **Done, gated** | Decisions identical across 5 configs; worst EU abs 1.9e-6, rel 4.8e-7. |
| Phase 4b — Mesa-native driving (scaffold) | **Done, gated** | `run_mesa_native == engine.run` bit-for-bit; examples 01–07 run (exit 0). |
| Phase 4b-full — native-class integration | **Done, gated** | `run_mesa_native_full == run_mesa_native == engine.run` bit-for-bit; real honeybees `Model` + native `DecisionModule`; real-table run (Sec.6.3). |
| Engine performance (interp cache + `n_jobs`) | **Done** | Full-scale bottleneck fixed; parallel sequences bit-identical (Sec.9). |
| Real-table gate (PRE.2) | **Done / PASS** | `gate_pass: True` on the real 61,858 × 207 table (Sec.9). |
| CI | **Present, green** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: matrix pytest + examples + vendored 4b gate. |
| Test suite | **147 passing** | bridge, engine, rules, agent state, event utils, live-parity, mesa-native, mesa-native-full, perf. |
| Notebook 2 (`2_simulate_adaptation.ipynb`) | Legacy path | Still uses `ABMSimulator`; the engine path is notebook `3_simulate_adaptation_engine.ipynb`. |

## 9. Engine performance & the real-table gate (PRE.2)

Running PRE.2 at full scale surfaced a hot-path bottleneck (>11 min). Two independent
causes were found and fixed as **committed engine improvements** (commit `6f45d6f`),
bit-identical, benefiting the coming 4b-full runs.

**Root causes.** (1) `prepare_damage_arrays()` re-interpolated the whole 61,858 × 207
catalogue on *every tick of every sequence* though the SLR trajectory is identical across
sequences (`no_seq×` redundant, ~5.5 s/call). (2) The residential subset used a boolean
`isel` on the lazily backed xarray cube — pathologically slow (~24 s first materialize).

**Fixes.**
- `lookup_utils`: split `materialize_strategy_cube()` (materialize full cube in NumPy, then mask in-memory) from `interpolate_cube_at_slr()` (unchanged `interp1d` math → bit-identical).
- Bridge: materialize each strategy cube **once**; memoise `prepare_damage_arrays` per `(SLR, method)`; cached arrays read-only; `clear_interp_cache()` frees memory.
- `SimulationEngine.run(n_jobs=N)`: run independent sequences across a thread pool of per-worker engine clones sharing a pre-warmed read-only cache. `n_jobs=1` (default) leaves the sequential path untouched; parallel output is **bit-identical** for deterministic rules. `DecisionRule.clone()` gives isolated per-worker rules.

**Measured effect (real Charleston table).**

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| First cube materialization (masked) | ~24 s | ~3.6 s |
| Interpolation per distinct SLR | ~5.5 s | ~1.0 s |
| Interpolation on repeated SLR | ~5.5 s | ~0 s (cache hit) |
| `engine.run` 4 seq × 30 y (sequential) | 116.7 s | — |
| `engine.run` 4 seq × 30 y (`n_jobs=-1`) | — | 83.3 s (×1.4, bit-identical) |

**Gate outcome.** `verification/real_table_gate/real_table_report.md`: `Gate: PASS` —
`phase4b_bit_parity_real_table: True`, `phase4a_parity_real_table_subset: True`.
57,976 residential agents (of 61,858 objects), 3 seq × 30 y; run A (parallel `engine.run`)
73.7 s / 3.3 GiB, run B (`run_mesa_native`) 119.4 s / 4.8 GiB, per-tick mean 2.62 s / max 8.96 s.

**Further speedups (noted, not required for the MVP):** process pool for the Python-bound
SEU math; float32 damage arrays; reusing prepared damages across gate runs; further
vectorising the decision kernel.

## 10. Issues found & resolutions (consolidated)

Merged from the 2026-07-08 and 2026-07-09 review tables; all rows now resolved except
where noted.

| Sev. | Issue | Location | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | `cfg.environment.max_slr` crash in the demo summary | `run_coupled_example.py` | Fixed (Phase 0). |
| Med | `DecisionConfig` docstring defaults ≠ actual defaults | `coupling_config.py` | Reconciled to `settings.yml`; docstring authoritative (Phase 0). |
| Med | Inline event draw / cap duplicated across scripts; freq-based cap | example scripts | Moved to core; **random** pool selection (Phase 2). |
| Med | `read_impacts_dataset` assumed row order == object_id order | `setup_lookup_table.py` | `object_id`-indexed accessor + alignment assert (Phase 2). |
| Med | Shared-engine `reset_state()` footgun | `mesa_native.py:174` | `state_epoch` guard + tests (PRE.3). |

| Med | V1–V6 battery ran on the old bridge API | `run_seu_validation.py` | Battery re-run + figures regenerated (VER.1); V5 nuance below. |
| Med | V5 lifespan report said "GAP" though reset shipped | `05_lifespan.md` | Reset implemented + unit-tested on the engine; standalone-harness port is the VER.1 residual. |
| Med | Stale root `README.md` | `README.md` | Rewritten (HYG.1); later extended with the performance section. |
| Med | No CI | repo root | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (HYG.3). |
| Low | Machine-specific absolute paths; unvendored bundles | `AGENTS.md`, `verification_tests/*` | Purged to env vars; bundles vendored (HYG.2, VER.2). |
| Low | Doc paths pointed at repo root, not `floodadapt_abm/` | `coupling_architecture.md` | Repo-relative; doc relocated into this repo's `docs/`. |
| Low | Hardcoded `INITIAL_YEAR=2020` / `TIME_HORIZON=30` in the demo | `run_coupled_example.py:52` | Superseded by the engine/notebook path (derive from SLR metadata). |
| Low | `.docx` phase docs not diffable | `docs/` | Converted to Markdown; this doc is the consolidated record. |

## 11. Roadmap (next steps)

Guiding principle: unify the plumbing, keep the decision logic pluggable, validate before
refactoring, never regress the `ThresholdRule` path. 4b-full is entered as **pure
infrastructure wiring** with its top risks (version drift, scale, adapter correctness,
state sharing) already retired in 4b-pre.

### 11.1 Phase 4b-pre — de-risking & hygiene — ✅ DONE (2026-07-09)

PRE.1–4, HYG.1–4, VER.1–2 all closed (Sec.7, Sec.14). The 4b-pre gate is **OPEN** — 4b-full
proceeded.

### 11.2 Phase 4b-full — native-class integration — ✅ DONE (2026-07-09)

Delivered as `floodadapt_abm/mesa_native_full.py` (Sec.6.3). The chosen seam is
**native-class integration**: the real honeybees `Model` owns the tick loop and the native
DYNAMO-M `DecisionModule` performs the decision math, while the population is fed from the
FloodAdapt lookup table via the PRE.4 adapter and every numeric per-year operation is
delegated to the validated `SimulationEngine.step` kernel with the identical RNG stream.
This keeps the whole path bit-for-bit identical to the 4b scaffold and `engine.run`.

| Step | Task | Risk | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pin honeybees/mesa; verify config compatibility. **(done as PRE.1)** | Low | Import test PASS (mesa 3.3.1 / honeybees 1.2.0) |
| 2 | Subclass the real honeybees `Model` (`FloodAdaptSLRModelFull`); own the clock via `current_time`/`current_timestep`/`end_time`; guarded import. | Medium | **DONE** — `Model` construction succeeds; package still imports without honeybees |
| 3 | Feed the coastal-node population from the lookup table via the PRE.4 adapter (forward `populate` / reverse `write_back` each tick). | Medium | **DONE** — round-trip reproduces the 4b scaffold |
| 4 | Route decisions through the native `DecisionModule.calcEU_*` (`DynamoLiveRule`) → node state. | Medium | **DONE** — decisions recorded in native arrays; native-vs-ported EU max abs ≈ 2.9e-6 |
| 5 | Example (`07_mesa_native_full.py`) + thorough verification battery (G1 multi-seed/sequence parity, G2 EU parity, G3 adapter/staleness, G4 real-table run). | Medium | **DONE** — battery `gate_pass: True`; real ~58k-household run recorded |
| 6 | Execute the 4b-full gate: 4b-full ≡ 4b-scaffold ≡ `engine.run` bit-for-bit. | Low | **PASS** — element-wise equality across seeds/sequences; **+22 tests → 147 PASS** |

Scope note: GLOFRIS/gravity CWD, `spin_up_flag`, low-memory `.npz` paging and the native
reporter are intentionally **out of MVP scope**. 
**Why don't we use the real DYNAMO-M geography setup?** Because we want to keep things lightweight. DYNAMO-M uses a complex geospatial data loading system (multi-gigabyte rasters for amenities, gravity models for population migration between municipalities, etc.). The objective of the `FloodAdapt-ABM` coupling is to build a fast Monte-Carlo simulator that strictly evaluates the SEU decision math against the FloodAdapt (SFINCS+FIAT) precomputed lookup table. By stripping out the heavy geospatial rasters, gravity models, and internal flood routing physics, the `FloodAdapt-ABM` simulator can execute tens of thousands of sequences per minute in parallel. Thus, the native `CoastalNode.step()` is too entangled with that heavy data ecosystem, so 4b-full reuses the validated engine kernel for the per-tick physics and the native `DecisionModule` for the decision math, inside a real honeybees `Model`. Those sub-systems remain available for a future full-geodata run (context in Sec.12.3).

### 11.3 Phase 5 — extending decision rules (future)

`calcEU_insure` (insurance), migration + gravity, government/dike CBA — each as a new
rule/agent class, never engine surgery.

## 12. Phase-gate summary

## 14. Chronological progress log (day-by-day traceability)

Each dated artifact referenced below is retained locally under `docs/progress/` (Sec.18).

### 2026-07-07 → 2026-07-08 — Consolidation proposal & Phase 0–3 delivery
- Authored the coupling MVP proposal and the Strategy-Pattern target architecture; reconciled doc/code drift (docstrings, event-cap semantics, method names).
- Delivered Phases 0–3: the unified `SimulationEngine` + `AgentState` + `DecisionRule` ABC; `ThresholdRule`/`SEURule` on the interface; `time_adapted` + `lifespan_dryproof=75` reset.
- Wrapped Phase 4a (`DynamoLiveRule` parity oracle) and reorganised the examples into the numbered `examples_engine/` learning path (01–06). Delivered the Phase 4b scaffold (Mesa-native driving) with the bit-parity gate.
- Artifacts: `progress/proposed_architecture/20260708_proposed_development_architecture_steps.*`, `progress/performed_tasks/20260708_performed_tasks.*`, `progress/model_documentation/20260708_phase_3__model_documentaiton.*`, `progress/model_documentation/20260708_phase_4b__model_documentaiton.*`.

### 2026-07-09 (a) — Post-Phase-4b review & 4b-pre execution
- External review confirmed the gates were genuinely computed but flagged doc/reproducibility drift and synthetic-only validation.
- Executed the full 4b-pre phase, **one commit per task**: PRE.3 staleness guard (`7ceb144`), PRE.4 adapter prototype (`1cb7862`), PRE.1+PRE.2 harnesses (`fdaf257`), HYG.2 vendoring (`3af86e8`), HYG.1 README (`d05a97a`), HYG.3 CI (`8b7384c`), HYG.4 notebook + Markdown docs (`2225ae6`), AGENTS path purge (`87ea7c6`).
- Merged into `sahand-asgarpour/FloodAdapt-ABM` and executed on the primary workstation: **120 tests pass**; PRE.1 gate PASS (mesa 3.3.1 / honeybees 1.2.0); Phase-4a and Phase-4b gates PASS; VER.1 battery re-run (V1–V4/V6 PASS, V5 GAP on the legacy harness — engine path reset unit-tested).
- Artifacts: `progress/proposed_architecture/20260709_phase_pre_4b_full_proposed_development_architecture_steps.*`, `progress/performed_tasks/20260709_performed_tasks.*`, `progress/model_documentation/20260709_phase_4b_full__model_documentaiton.*`.

### 2026-07-09 (b) — PRE.2 real-table gate + engine speedups
- Ran PRE.2 on the real 61,858 × 207 Charleston table; hit a full-scale interpolation bottleneck and fixed it with the per-SLR cube cache + `n_jobs` parallel sequences (commit `6f45d6f`, bit-identical). +5 tests → **125 pass**. Gate **PASS**.
- Fixed a NumPy-2.0 `np.trapz` bug (`2035b80`). Recorded the work across `performed_tasks` Sec.6.1 and the architecture docs.

### 2026-07-09 (c) — Coupling-architecture relocation & docs reorg
- Moved `coupling_architecture.md` into this repo's `docs/`, refreshed it (paths, 125 tests, PRE.2 gate, engine perf), and propagated the speedups into `README.md` and `examples_engine/README.md` (commit `673c535`).
- Reorganised `docs/` into `docs/progress/{performed_tasks, proposed_architecture, model_documentation}/`; renamed the dated proposed doc to `..._phase_pre_4b_full_...` and the model docs to `*__model_documentaiton`; fixed the corrupt `.git/info/exclude`; produced this unified doc (+ Arial `.docx`).

### 2026-07-09 (d) — Phase 4b-full delivery & documentation consolidation
- Implemented **Phase 4b-full** (`floodadapt_abm/mesa_native_full.py`): the real honeybees `Model` owns the tick loop and the native DYNAMO-M `DecisionModule` performs the decision math, with the population fed from the lookup table via the PRE.4 adapter and the per-tick physics delegated to the validated `SimulationEngine.step` kernel. Added `07_mesa_native_full.py`, the `verification/mesa_native_full/` battery (G1–G4, `gate_pass: True`, real ~58k-household Charleston run), and **+22 tests → 147 pass**.
- Consolidated the docs into the best-practice set: this merged, standalone `architecture.md` (from `coupling_architecture.md` ∪ the all-phases record), the whole-repo `floodadapt_abm_documentation.md`, a kept `AGENTS.md` and `adaptation_decisions_complete.md`; superseded per-phase/model/proposed docs moved to `docs/archive/`. Regenerated Arial `.docx` for the two-format docs and synced to OneDrive.

## 15. Definition of done & alignment with the objective

- **Science validated on the shipped code:** V1–V6 on `SimulationEngine` + `SEURule` (V5 demonstrating lifespan turnover; standalone-harness V5 port is the residual).
- **Backwards compatible:** `ThresholdRule` reproduces legacy output; existing notebooks keep working; an engine-based notebook exists.
- **Single source of truth:** one interpolation kernel, one event generator, one time loop, one pluggable decision interface — and one accurate README + this consolidated design record.
- **Reproducible:** verification bundles vendored, portable (env-var paths, figures present), executed by CI on every push.
- **Scale-aware:** the engine and tick driver run on the real Charleston table (61k+ objects) with recorded runtime/memory, after the interpolation-cache + parallel-sequence speedups.
- **Extension-ready:** insurance, migration and government agents arrive as new rules without touching the engine; 4b-full entered as pure infrastructure wiring with its risks retired in 4b-pre, and is now delivered (native honeybees `Model` + native `DecisionModule`, gate PASS).

## 16. Go/No-Go

Phases 0–4b (scaffold), 4b-pre and **4b-full** are COMPLETE with all gates PASS
(**147 tests**). The final integration step is delivered: the real honeybees `Model`
drives the native `DecisionModule` over the lookup-table-fed population, bit-for-bit
identical to the scaffold and `engine.run`. Every headline risk (version drift, scale,
adapter correctness, state sharing) was retired in 4b-pre. Remaining open items are
non-blocking (VER.1 residual V5 harness port, VER.3 empirical lifespan reference) and
**Phase 5** (insurance / migration / government rules as new pluggable rules).

# Part II - Technical reference (full architecture, SEU math, diagrams, walkthrough)

> standalone `coupling_architecture.md`, now merged here). Part I above is the

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **MVP** replaces the simple rule-based adaptation logic in FloodAdapt-ABM
> (`If building flooded with damage ratio > 0.3 → floodproof`) with DYNAMO-M's
> **Subjective Expected Utility (SEU)** household decision framework, while
> **keeping FloodAdapt-ABM's own household-elevation assumption** (damages of an
> adapted household are read from the `floodproof_all_0` strategy in the lookup
> table — see Sec.1).

> [!NOTE]
> **Overruling of DYNAMO-M's Internal Hazard and Dike Mechanics**:
> When DYNAMO-M's decision module is integrated into FloodAdapt-ABM, DYNAMO-M's internal water level interpolation (`interpolate_water_levels`) and dike overtopping checks (`sample_water_level`) are **completely bypassed**. 
> Instead, all physical flood depths and building damages are dictated by FloodAdapt's SFINCS (hydrodynamic) and FIAT (damage) models, which are pre-computed in the lookup table. Consequently, the DYNAMO-M overtopping checks (such as the 0% cell failure threshold) and GLOFRIS/Aqueduct map scaling do not run, as these physics are already captured by the SFINCS/FIAT runs.

### MVP Scope Definition (traceable to DYNAMO-M P-steps)

| Aspect | MVP (Current) | DYNAMO-M P-step | Future Extension |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Agent types** | Households (= residential buildings) only | P4e | Government agent (dike CBA) |
| **Decisions included** | Dry flood-proofing (elevate) OR do nothing | P4e | Insurance, migration |
| **Floodproofing height** | **FloodAdapt-ABM** fixed height (`floodproof_all_0`, set at lookup creation) | — | Variable height per household |
| **Damage source** | FloodAdapt-ABM lookup table (replaces DYNAMO-M `FloodRisk.calculate_ead`) | replaces P4c | Same |
| **Migration** | ❌ Excluded | P4e/P5 | ✅ Full migration + gravity model |
| **Insurance** | ❌ Excluded | P4b/P4e | ✅ `calcEU_insure()` + insurer agent |
| **Government agent** | ❌ Excluded | P4a | ✅ Dike CBA, FPS maintenance |
| **Population / GDP growth** | ❌ Excluded | P1/P2 | ✅ income/wealth dynamics |
| **Risk perception dynamics** | ✅ Exponential decay after flood | P4c | Same |
| **SEU framework** | ✅ `calcEU_do_nothing()` + `calcEU_adapt()` | P4e | Add `calcEU_insure()` + `EU_migrate()` |
| **Adaptation lifespan** | ✅ Enforced (`lifespan_dryproof` = 75 y, see Sec.3.4) | P4e/Sec.3.9 | Same |
| **Affordability constraint** | ✅ Enforced inside `calcEU_adapt` (`expenditure_cap`) | P4e | Same |

### Possible Extensions Beyond MVP

1. **Insurance** — add `calcEU_insure()`; requires an `InsurerAgent` that derives a community-rated premium (`premium = EAD_total / n_households`). Decision becomes argmax over three options.
2. **Migration** — add `EU_migrate()` with destination evaluation, gravity model, and the intention-to-behaviour filter (12%). Requires cross-region population tracking.
3. **Government agent** — add `GovernmentAgent` with CBA-based dike-elevation decisions; requires multi-year water-level projections.

### Terminology

Throughout this document **"household" = one `object_id` row in the lookup
table = one residential building**. Non-residential FIAT objects are excluded
from the SEU decision (see Sec.2.5).

---

## 1. What Gets Replaced in FloodAdapt-ABM

### 1.1 Current Simple Rule (to be replaced)

**File**: `abm_simulator.py`, method `_simulate_damage_history()` — the
vectorized floodproofing decision block at the end of the per-year loop:

```python
# CURRENT LOGIC — simple threshold rule
not_floodproofed = ~is_floodproofed
with_pot_dmg = self.max_pot_dmg > 0
threshold_exceeded = np.zeros(self.n_households, dtype=bool)
valid = not_floodproofed & with_pot_dmg
threshold_exceeded[valid] = (
    total_damage[valid] / self.max_pot_dmg[valid]
) > self.damage_threshold      # self.damage_threshold = 0.3
is_floodproofed = is_floodproofed | threshold_exceeded
```

**What this does**: after the realised damage of year `t`, each non-adapted
household floodproofs iff `total_damage / max_pot_dmg > 0.3`. It is
deterministic, one-shot, reactive, and has no economic reasoning.

### 1.2 What we KEEP from FloodAdapt-ABM

- **The household-elevation assumption.** Once a household is floodproofed,
  damages are read from the **`floodproof_all_0`** strategy in the lookup table
  (a fixed elevation height defined at lookup-table creation). DYNAMO-M's own
  "1 m dry-proofing" assumption is **not** imported — see Sec.3.6.
- The lookup-table interpolation mechanism (`interpolate_damage_matrix()`).
- The Monte-Carlo event-sequence generation (`generate_event_sequences()`).
- The overall simulation loop in `_simulate_damage_history()` (baseline +
  adaptive passes via `run_simulation()`).
- All plotting (`plot_event_damage_timeseries`, `plot_total_damage_statistics`).

### 1.3 HARD REQUIREMENT on the lookup table (exceedance semantics)

DYNAMO-M's SEU integrates utility over an **exceedance-probability curve**
`p = 1 / return_period`, sorted ascending, integrated on `[0, 1]` via
`np.trapz` (see Sec.4.1). FloodAdapt-ABM stores `ds.event.attrs["freq"]` as
**events/year**. For `p_floods = freq` to be a valid exceedance curve, the
**stage-1 lookup table MUST be built from an `EventSet` whose sub-events are a
true return-period set** — DYNAMO-M's canonical RPs are
`[2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]` years
(`input_data_requirements.md` Sec.3.1, Sec.7.1).

> If a non-RP `EventSet` must be used, derive a per-household exceedance curve
> by sorting events on each household's damage before calling the bridge. This
> is heavier and is **not** the MVP path.

## 2. What Gets Used from DYNAMO-M

### 2.1 Functions Required (MVP)

> Referenced by **name** (not line number) to stay robust across DYNAMO-M revisions.

| Function | Source | Purpose in coupling |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| `DecisionModule.calcEU_do_nothing()` | `decision_module.py` | SEU of status quo (no adaptation) |
| `DecisionModule.calcEU_adapt()` | `decision_module.py` | SEU of dry flood-proofing (cost + affordability built in) |
| `DecisionModule.IterateThroughFlood()` | `decision_module.py` (`@staticmethod @njit`) | Time-discounted NPV across flood events; used by both EU functions |
| `DecisionModule.sample_error_terms()` | `decision_module.py` | Uniform noise (`error_terms_stay`) — **must be called before any EU call** |
| Risk-perception formula | `hazards/flooding/flood_risk.py` | `max × base^(coef × flood_timer) + min` |
| Income–wealth ratio table | `decision_module.py` (`DecisionModule.__init__`) | `[0, 1.06, 4.14, 4.19, 5.24, 6]` interpolated over percentile |

### 2.2 DYNAMO-M Parameters Required (MVP) — with provenance

Provenance legend: **LUT** = from FloodAdapt lookup table; **SET** = DYNAMO-M
`settings.yml` default; **NEW** = new input the analyst must supply for the ABM
site (no existing FloodAdapt-ABM source).

| Parameter | Provenance | DYNAMO-M source (`input_data_requirements.md`) | Default | Unit | Description |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|---------|------|-------------|
| `income` | NEW | `gdl_income_2015.tif` + `mean_median_WIID.csv` + `adjusted_net_national_income_pc_*.csv` (Sec.3.5–3.6) | — | USD/yr | Household annual income |
| `income_percentile` | NEW | `households_gdl_2015/<size>/<geom_id>/income_percentile.npy` (Sec.3.2) | — | 0–100 | Income-distribution position |
| `wealth` | derived | `income × income_wealth_ratio(percentile)` | — | USD | Total wealth |
| `property_value` | LUT | use FIAT `max_pot_dmg` (cap at wealth per `adaptation_decisions_complete.md` Sec.5) | — | USD | Exposure / max damage |
| `adaptation_costs` | NEW | `ECONOMY/PROCESSED/scaled_adaptation_cost.csv` → `model.data.adaptation_cost` (Sec.3.5, Sec.8.5) | — | USD/yr | Annual loan repayment for dry-proofing |
| `risk_aversion` (σ) | SET | `decisions.risk_aversion` | 1 | – | CRRA coefficient (σ=1 → log utility) |
| `decision_horizon` (T) | SET | `decisions.decision_horizon` | 15 | yr | NPV planning horizon |
| `time_discounting` (r) | SET | `decisions.time_discounting` | 0.032 | /yr | Discount rate |
| `expenditure_cap` | SET | `adaptation.expenditure_cap` | 0.06 | frac | Max income fraction for adaptation |
| `loan_duration` (L) | SET | `adaptation.loan_duration` | 16 | yr | Loan repayment period |
| `interest_rate` (r_loan) | SET | `adaptation.interest_rate` | 0.04 | /yr | Loan interest rate |
| `lifespan_dryproof` | SET | `adaptation.lifespan_dryproof` | 75 | yr | Dry-proofing lifetime (triggers re-decision) |
| `error_interval` | SET | `decisions.error_interval` | 0.0 | frac | Uniform noise on EU |
| `amenity_weight` | SET | `decisions.migration.amenity_weight` | 1 | – | Amenity weight in utility |
| `amenity_value` (A) | derived | `amenity_premium × wealth × amenity_weight` (set 0 for MVP) | 0 | USD | Location value |
| `risk_perception` | dynamic | risk-perception formula (driven by `flood_timer`) | 0.01–2.01 | – | Subjective probability multiplier |
| `flood_timer` | dynamic | reset to 0 on flood, else `+1` | 0 | yr | Years since last flood |

#### Risk perception dynamics (worked example)

```
risk_perception = risk_perc_max × base^(coef × flood_timer) + risk_perc_min
                = 2.0 × 1.6^(-3.6 × flood_timer) + 0.01
```

| `flood_timer` | risk_perception |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 0 (just flooded) | ≈ **2.01** |
| 1 | ≈ 0.86 |
| 2 | ≈ 0.38 |
| 5 | ≈ 0.024 |
| ≥10 | ≈ **0.010** (background) |

Perception spikes right after a flood and decays exponentially toward the
minimum — the "availability heuristic". This replaces the static 0.3 threshold.

### 2.3 DYNAMO-M Inputs (what it needs from FloodAdapt-ABM each timestep)

> ⚠️ The SEU is **ex-ante**: it consumes the **full per-event damage matrix at
> the current SLR**, *not* the realised one-year `total_damage`.

| Input | Source in FloodAdapt-ABM | Shape | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|-------|-------------|

### 2.4 DYNAMO-M Outputs (what FloodAdapt-ABM gets back)

| Output | Type | Shape | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| `adapt_decision` | bool | `(n_households,)` | Newly adopting dry flood-proofing this step |
| `risk_perception` | float32 | `(n_households,)` | Updated perceived risk (diagnostics) |
| `EU_adapt`, `EU_do_nothing` | float32 | `(n_households,)` | Utilities, persisted in `bridge.eu_history` `(n_seq, n_hh, n_t, 2)` for analysis |

### 2.5 Household selection (residential only)

FIAT objects include commercial, industrial, public, and residential buildings. The NetCDF lookup table contains building classifications inside `ds.object_id.attrs['primary_object_type']`. In the Charleston dataset, these values include pure types and mixed types:
- Pure types: `'RES'` (Residential), `'COM'` (Commercial), `'IND'` (Industrial), `'PUB'` (Public).
- Mixed types: `'COM_RES'`, `'IND_RES'`, `'PUB_RES'`, `'COM_IND_RES'`, and others.

To capture all households, the decision bridge **must use substring-based filtering** (checking if the type contains `'RES'`) rather than exact equality (`primary_object_type == 'RES'`). Objects that do not contain `'RES'` in their classification are non-residential and are **excluded from the SEU decision** (kept at the `no_measures` baseline for all years). Decision arrays remain full-sized and aligned to `object_id`; excluded rows get `is_residential = False` and `adapt_decision = False`.

In Python, this is implemented as:
```python
is_residential = np.char.find(primary_object_type.astype(str), "RES") >= 0
```

## 3. Proposed Architecture

### 3.1 Design Overview

A **bridge class** `DynamoDecisionBridge` (new file
`dynamo_decision_bridge.py`) encapsulates the DYNAMO-M SEU logic needed for the
MVP. `ABMSimulator` owns one bridge and calls it once per `(sequence, year)`
instead of the simple threshold rule.

**Packaging decision (resolves the "ported vs imported" ambiguity): PORT.**
The three pure NumPy/Numba pieces — `IterateThroughFlood`, the CRRA + `np.trapz`
block, and the risk-perception formula — are **copied** into
`dynamo_decision_bridge.py`. DYNAMO-M is **not** imported, because
`decision_module.py` begins with `from gravity_models.read_gravity_model import
read_gravity_model`, which only resolves when CWD is `DYNAMO-M/DYNAMO-M`.
Porting keeps FloodAdapt-ABM self-contained. `environment.yml` therefore gains
`numba` (and `scipy`, already present transitively via `flood-adapt`).

### 3.2 Data Flow — One Timestep

### 3.4 Adaptation lifespan (enforced)

Per `adaptation_decisions_complete.md` Sec.3.9, when `time_adapted` reaches
`lifespan_dryproof` (75 y) the measure expires: `is_floodproofed → False`,
`time_adapted → 0`, and the household re-decides next year. This is implemented
in `evaluate_decisions` step (a) so adaptation is **not** permanent.

**Sequential Adaptation**: Agents can adapt multiple times by elevating their house, but **only sequentially**. They cannot stack elevations cumulatively. Once the lifespan is reached and the adaptation resets, the household can re-evaluate and choose to adopt the `floodproof_all_0` strategy again if it is the best affordable option.

### 3.5 SLR-evolving damages (myopic NPV — MVP choice)

DYNAMO-M's NPV holds `D_i` constant across the horizon `T`. FloodAdapt-ABM
damages evolve with SLR (`damage_matrix[..., t]`). **MVP uses the myopic
choice**: damages at the current `t` are used for the whole horizon inside
`IterateThroughFlood`. A foresighted variant (pass a `(n_events, n_hh, T)`
tensor and discount the evolving path) is a documented future extension.

### 3.6 Elevation-height reconciliation (keep ABM assumption)

DYNAMO-M's `calcEU_adapt` is built around a **1 m** dry-proofing damage sheet
(`dryproof_1m`). Per the task requirement we **keep FloodAdapt-ABM's elevation
assumption** instead: the bridge receives the ABM's
`damage_matrix_floodproofing_all` (from strategy `floodproof_all_0`) as
`expected_damages_adapted`. Thus only DYNAMO-M's **decision math** is reused;
the **reduced-damage curve is FloodAdapt-ABM's**, and the 1 m sheet is never
imported.

### 3.7 Realized Events vs Theoretical Probabilities (SEU Integration)

There is a strict separation between **what actually happens** (the FloodAdapt-ABM Monte Carlo sequence) and **what the household expects will happen in the future** (the DYNAMO-M SEU decision integral). The integral is **NOT** computed over the events that happened that specific year.

1. **The Realized Reality (FloodAdapt-ABM Monte Carlo):** In any given simulation year `t`, the Monte Carlo sequence dictates which events actually happened. FloodAdapt-ABM takes those specific events, calculates the actual damage suffered by the household, and deducts it from their wealth. If the household suffered damage > 0, their `flood_timer` is reset to 0.
2. **The Household's Decision (DYNAMO-M SEU Integral):** After experiencing the events of year `t`, the household looks to the future (their decision horizon) to decide if they should elevate their house. To make this decision, the household integrates over the **entire theoretical spectrum of all possible events** provided by the Stage-1 lookup table (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000-year events).

**Why a single event (e.g., only a 250-year event) breaks the math:**
If the lookup table only contains a 250-year event (`p = 0.004`), `np.trapz` is forced to draw a curve with essentially two states: a 0.4% chance of catastrophic damage, and a 99.6% chance of exactly zero damage. The integral mathematically assumes that smaller floods (10-year, 50-year) cause no damage. The Expected Utility of "Do Nothing" becomes artificially high, and the household will never choose to adapt. The full spectrum of high-probability/low-severity events is required to mathematically justify adaptation costs under the CRRA utility function.

**How realized events influence the integral:**
While the integral uses theoretical probabilities, the realized Monte Carlo events indirectly drive the decision:
* **Wealth Reduction:** Actual floods reduce wealth, lowering the household's capacity to absorb future shocks or afford adaptation loans.
* **Risk Perception Spike (The Availability Heuristic):** The realized flood resets the `flood_timer`, causing the subjective `risk_perception` multiplier to spike (e.g., from 0.01 to 2.01). The household subjectively overestimates the probability of the *entire* theoretical curve, causing `EU_do_nothing` to plummet and triggering the decision to adapt.

### 3.8 Target Architecture — Strategy Pattern (Phase 2–3 Refactor)

The bridge in Sec.3.1–3.7 is the **validated MVP kernel** (Phase 1 complete). Sec.3.8 records the
**endorsed target structure** that Phases 2–3 refactor toward. The rationale: `ABMSimulator`
(legacy 0.3-threshold) and `DynamoDecisionBridge` (SEU) are the **same simulation engine with
different decision rules** — NetCDF loading, damage interpolation, stochastic event drawing,
state tracking, and the year loop are duplicated across both. The resolution is a single
`SimulationEngine` with a **pluggable `DecisionRule`** (Strategy Pattern).

```
SimulationEngine (single class)
  ├── NetCDF loading (via CouplingConfig / NetCDFMappingConfig)
  ├── Damage interpolation            → lookup_utils.py  (DONE — Phase 1)
  ├── Stochastic event draw (Bernoulli + max_events cap, RANDOM pool selection)
  ├── State tracking (is_adapted, damage_history, flood_timer, time_adapted)
  └── decision_rule: DecisionRule     ← pluggable
          ├── ThresholdRule   (dmg/max_pot_dmg > 0.3)          [legacy ABMSimulator]
          ├── SEURule         (DYNAMO-M utility math, ported)  [current bridge, Sec.3.3–4]
          └── DynamoLiveRule  (calls live DYNAMO-M DecisionModule)
                  ├── 4a: thin adapter / SEU parity oracle     [near-term, in-MVP]
                  └── 4b: full Mesa model.step() driving        [post-MVP]
```

**The `DecisionRule` interface** (stateless, vectorised, NumPy-first). The signature is widened
versus the current bridge so that `DynamoLiveRule` (which calls native `calcEU_*` directly) is
pluggable without further change:

```python
class DecisionRule:
    def __init__(self, config: DecisionConfig):   # r, sigma, loan_duration,
        ...                                        # expenditure_cap, amenity_weight, ...

    def should_adapt(self,
        agent_state: AgentState,      # wealth, income, risk_perception, flood_timer,
                                      #   is_adapted, time_adapted
        damages_this_year: np.ndarray,# (n_agents,)  realised damage this year (ex-post rules)
        damages_no_adapt: np.ndarray, # (n_agents, n_events)  full catalog @ SLR_t, no measures
        damages_adapt: np.ndarray,    # (n_agents, n_events)  full catalog @ SLR_t, floodproofed
        event_freqs: np.ndarray,      # (n_events,)  exceedance probs (= 1/RP)
        max_pot_dmg: np.ndarray,      # (n_agents,)
        adaptation_costs: np.ndarray, # (n_agents,)  annualised loan repayment
    ) -> np.ndarray:                  # (n_agents,) bool
        ...
```

**Interface-change rationale** (versus the 20260707 draft, endorsed in the 20260708 roadmap):
1. `AgentState` must carry `risk_perception` (not just `flood_timer`), because DYNAMO-M's
   `calcEU_*` consume it directly.
2. The rule receives **both** per-event damage matrices at the current SLR (`damages_no_adapt`
   and `damages_adapt`) rather than a single matrix plus the realised damage, because the SEU is
   **ex-ante** — `calcEU_adapt` / `calcEU_do_nothing` each integrate a full exceedance curve
   (see Sec.3.7). The realised `damages_this_year` scalar is *also* passed so the ex-post
   `ThresholdRule` retains its legacy semantics; `SEURule` ignores it.
3. `adaptation_costs` (annualised loan repayment) is passed explicitly.
4. Decision parameters (`r`, `sigma`, `loan_duration`, `expenditure_cap`, `amenity_weight`) are
   injected once via the constructor from `DecisionConfig`.
   `ThresholdRule` ignores the extra arguments, so **backward compatibility is preserved**.

**What gets unified** (cross-checked against code):

| Concern | Before (today) | After (target) |
|---|---|---|
| Damage interpolation | 2 implementations | `lookup_utils`, called by engine (DONE) |
| Event drawing | `ABMSimulator` + inline example code | 1 method in `SimulationEngine` (random pool selection) |
| State tracking | 2 separate array sets | 1 standardised `AgentState` container |
| Year loop | nested loops / manual demo loop | single `run()` / `step()` in engine |
| Decision logic | hardcoded in classes | pluggable `DecisionRule` |

**Coupling contract (must stay stable across refactors).** Per `(sequence, year)` the engine
performs the loop of Sec.3.2; the REPLACED block is the only decision-specific part and is delegated
to the rule. The payloads that cross the engine↔rule boundary are fixed:

| Direction | Payload | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| engine → rule | `damages_no_adapt` / `damages_adapt` @ SLR_t | `(n_events, n_hh)` |
| engine → rule | `p_floods` (= freq = 1/RP) | `(n_events,)` |
| engine → rule | `property_value` (`max_pot_dmg`) | `(n_hh,)` |
| engine → rule | `is_adapted`, `time_adapted`, `was_flooded` | `(n_hh,)` |
| rule → engine | `adapt_decision` | `(n_hh,)` bool |
| rule → engine | `risk_perception`, `EU_adapt`, `EU_do_nothing` (diagnostics) | `(n_hh,)` |

**Time progression.** In production the manual demo loop is discarded. Time is driven natively —
first by `SimulationEngine.run()`/`step()`, and ultimately by DYNAMO-M's Mesa `model.step()` cycle
calling the bridge each tick. Keeping the rule interface stable is what makes this migration
non-breaking, and preserves the long-term reverse-coupling vision (Sec.12.3).

> **Design principles enforced:** *Single Responsibility* — the engine owns time & data, the rule
> owns behaviour (no FloodAdapt or DYNAMO-M imports inside rule kernels). *Open/Closed* — new
> science (insurance, migration, live DYNAMO-M) arrives as a new `DecisionRule`, not by editing
> the engine. *Backward compatibility* — `ThresholdRule` reproduces legacy `ABMSimulator` output
> bit-for-bit. *Vectorisation & JIT* — keep `_iterate_through_flood` `@njit`-able; no per-household
> Python loops in hot paths.

See Sec.12.4 for the phased roadmap and the go/no-go gates that govern this refactor.

## 4. Detailed Mathematical Formulation (from DYNAMO-M)

### 4.1 SEU framework

**Utility (CRRA)**:
```
U(c) = c^(1-σ) / (1-σ)   if σ ≠ 1
U(c) = ln(c)             if σ = 1
```

**NPV for flood event i**:
`NPV_i = (W + Y + A - D_i) * (1 + sum_{t=1 to T-1} (1 / (1 + r)^t))`
where `W`=wealth, `Y`=income, `A`=amenity (`amenity_premium × wealth ×
amenity_weight`), `D_i`=expected damage of event i, `T`=horizon, `r`=discount.

**Perceived probability**: `p_perceived_i = p_actual_i × risk_perception`,
capped at 0.998.

**Expected utility**: `EU = ∫₀¹ U(NPV(p)) dp` via `np.trapz` over the
exceedance curve (with the two "no-flood" rows appended at high `p`).

### 4.2 EU of Do Nothing (`calcEU_do_nothing`)
```
D_i = expected_damages_no_adapt[i]
EU_do_nothing = ∫₀¹ U(NPV(p)) dp
If already adapted (is_floodproofed): EU_do_nothing = -∞   (prevents un-adapting)
```

### 4.3 EU of Dry Flood-Proofing (`calcEU_adapt`)
```

annual_cost = total_cost × [r_loan(1+r_loan)^L / ((1+r_loan)^L − 1)]
cost = Σ_{t=0}^{min(loan_left, T)} annual_cost / (1+r)^t,  loan_left = L − time_adapted
NPV_adapt_i = NPV_i − cost
Affordability (INSIDE the function): if income × expenditure_cap ≤ adaptation_costs → EU_adapt = −∞
NPV is clipped to ≥1 before U() (see note below).
```

> **NPV-clip note (A7).** `calcEU_adapt` does `NPV = max(1, NPV)` and prints a
> warning per clipped household. For ABM sites where `max_pot_dmg` ≈ synthetic
> `wealth`, this clips often and spams stdout. Mitigate by (a) silencing the

### 4.4 Decision rule (MVP)
```python
adapt_decision = (EU_adapt > EU_do_nothing) & (~is_floodproofed) & is_residential
# Affordability is NOT re-checked here — it is already encoded as EU_adapt = -inf
# inside calcEU_adapt (avoids logic drift). (A4)
```

## 10. Walkthrough Example: Step-by-Step Coupled Simulation

This section presents a concrete, followable, and mathematically complete walkthrough of how the coupled FloodAdapt-ABM and DYNAMO-M decision framework operates over time. It traces agent state changes, environmental dynamics, model-to-model interactions, and individual Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) calculations.

---

### 10.1 High-Level Overview of the Year Loop Interactions

Before detailing the numerical example, the diagram and steps below summarize the yearly simulation cycle. This overview shows how environmental changes and physical model outputs drive agent perceptions, financial state updates, and cognitive adaptation decisions.

#### Suggested Modeling Diagrams:
1. **Coupled Timeline/Sequence Diagram**: Visualizes the flow from hydrodynamic mapping (FloodAdapt) to impact evaluation (FIAT) to economic updates and SEU decision (DYNAMO-M).
2. **Household State Transition Diagram**: Shows a household transitioning from `Unadapted` -(SEU Decision)-> `Adapted` -(Lifespan Expiration: 75 yr)-> `Unadapted` (re-evaluation).

#### Coupled Step-by-Step Year Loop:
1. **Economic Growth Update (P2)**: Household incomes (Y_t) are updated based on national/regional GDP growth rates. Wealth (W_t) is updated to maintain alignment with the new income percentile.
2. **Hazard Damage Interpolation (P4c)**: FloodAdapt-ABM (Stage 2) interpolates expected damages for the current Sea Level Rise (SLR_t) from the pre-computed Stage-1 lookup table (SFINCS/FIAT).
3. **Monte Carlo Realization (P4c)**: The simulator draws a concrete event sequence (representing the physical weather of that year). Realized damages reduce agent wealth (W_t) directly. If a flood occurs, the household's subjective risk-decay timer (`flood_timer`) is reset to 0.
4. **Cognitive SEU Assessment (P4e)**: Households evaluate whether to elevate their homes. This involves calculating their Subjective Expected Utility for both "Do Nothing" and "Adapt" over the theoretical probability distribution (ex-ante risk curve). This is driven by their current wealth, spiked risk perception, and loan affordability constraints.
5. **State Commitment**: If the household decides to adapt, they transition to `is_floodproofed = True`, paying the annual loan repayment starting next year, and their future damages are read from the adapted (`floodproof_all_0`) lookup table strategy.

### 10.3 Walkthrough Calibration & Toy System Setup

We define a toy floodplain with three building agents:

1. **Household A (Residential - Middle Income)**
   - Income (Y_A): $50,000 | Initial Wealth (W_A): $100,000
   - Property Value / Max Damage (P_V, A): $80,000
   - Classification: Residential (Subject to SEU calculation)
2. **Household B (Residential - Low Income)**
   - Income (Y_B): $15,000 | Initial Wealth (W_B): $30,000
   - Property Value / Max Damage (P_V, B): $40,000
   - Classification: Residential (Subject to SEU calculation)
3. **Household C (Commercial - Local Grocery)**
   - Property Value (P_V, C): $120,000
   - Classification: Commercial (Bypassed by SEU; remains on baseline `no_measures`)

#### Parameters for Hand Calculation:
- **Risk Aversion (σ)**: 1.0 (Logarithmic utility: `U(c) = ln(c)`).
- **Decision Horizon (T)**: 2 years (evaluates NPV at t = 0 and t = 1).
- **Discount Rate (r)**: 0.0 (no time discounting, for simpler hand math).
- **Loan Duration (L)**: 16 years | **Interest Rate (r_loan)**: 0.0.
- **Expenditure Cap**: 0.06 (maximum adaptation payment = Y * 0.06).
- **Dry-Proofing Annual Loan Cost**: $1,000/year for both households.
- **Error Terms**: `error_terms_stay = 1.0` (no noise).

#### Hazard & Stage-1 Lookup Table:
- **Event**: A 10-year return period flood (RP = 10, actual exceedance frequency p_actual = 0.1).
- **Expected Damages**:
  - **No measures strategy (`no_measures`)**:
    - Household A damage: D_no_adapt, A = $40,000
    - Household B damage: D_no_adapt, B = $20,000
  - **Dry-proofing strategy (`floodproof_all_0`)**:

### 10.4 Key Formulations

#### 10.4.1 Risk Perception Exponential Decay
*   **Formula**:
    `risk_perception = risk_perc_max * base^(coef * flood_timer) + risk_perc_min`
*   **Decay Parameters**: risk_perc_max = 2.0, base = 1.6, coef = -3.6, risk_perc_min = 0.01.

#### 10.4.2 Perceived Flood Probability
*   **Formula**:
    `p_perceived = p_actual * risk_perception`

#### 10.4.3 Net Present Value (NPV)
With T = 2 and r = 0, the NPV simplifies to:
`NPV_state = (W + Y - D_state) * (1 + sum_{t=1 to 1} 1) = 2 * (W + Y - D_state)`

*   **Formulation Explanation**:
    The summation represents discounting over the decision horizon T (from year 1 to year T-1).
    `NPV_state = (W + Y - D_state) * (1 + sum_{t=1 to T-1} (1 / (1 + r)^t))`
    Since T = 2 and r = 0.0:
    - The upper limit of the summation is T-1 = 2-1 = 1, so the index t runs from 1 to 1 (yielding exactly one term for t=1).
    - Since r = 0, the term is 1 / (1 + 0)^1 = 1.
    - Therefore, the factor is 1 + sum_{t=1 to 1} 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
    - Hence:
      `NPV_state = 2 * (W + Y - D_state)`
*   For **Do Nothing**: D_state = D_no_adapt.
*   For **Adapt**: D_state = D_adapt, and we subtract the discounted loan payment over T=2 (which is 2 * $1,000 = $2,000):
    `NPV_adapt = 2 * (W + Y - D_adapt) - 2000`

#### 10.4.4 Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) Integration
For n_floods = 1 event:
*   Coordinates: `x = [0, p_perceived, p_perceived + 0.001, 1.0]`
*   Utilities: `y = [U(NPV_flood), U(NPV_flood), U(NPV_no-flood), U(NPV_no-flood)]`
*   Using the trapezoidal rule, the integral simplifies to:
    `EU = (p_perceived + 0.0005) * U(NPV_flood) + (1.0 - p_perceived - 0.0005) * U(NPV_no-flood)`
*   *Note*: The 0.0005 area factor represents half of the 0.001 transition step size (delta / 2). The term (p_perceived + 0.0005) represents the effective weight of the flood utility, and (1.0 - p_perceived - 0.0005) represents the effective weight of the status quo (no-flood) utility.

#### 10.4.5 Physical and Mathematical Capping Constraints (Property & Wealth Capping)
DYNAMO-M requires capping constraints to be applied during the simulation timestep before SEU calculations:
1.  **Wealth Capping**: Caps the household's property value at their current wealth:
    `property_value = min(max_pot_dmg, W)`
    *   *Physical Rationale*: A household's total wealth represents the sum of their property asset value and liquid savings. Thus, a household cannot own a home whose replacement value exceeds their total wealth. This ensures the agent-based assets remain physically consistent with their economic status.
    *   *Mathematical Rationale (Utility Stability)*: DYNAMO-M uses logarithmic utility (U(c) = ln(c)) or CRRA utility. The argument of the utility function (the Net Present Value, NPV = 2 * (W + Y - D)) must be strictly positive. If wealth falls and expected damages (D) are allowed to exceed wealth and income, NPV would become negative, causing the utility calculations to fail (e.g. `ln(negative)`). Wealth capping is the first line of defense to keep NPV positive.
2.  **Property Value Capping**: Expected and realized flood damages (D_i) are capped at the property value:
    `D_i = min(D_i, property_value)`
    *   *Physical Rationale*: A flood cannot cause more economic damage to a building than the total replacement value of the building itself (the property value).
    *   *Data Calibration Guard*: When coupling with an external hazard model like FloodAdapt, damage values are interpolated from depth-damage curves. In extreme sea-level-rise scenarios, deep inundation can occasionally produce interpolated damages that exceed the building's asset value in the FIAT exposure table. Capping damages at the property value filters out these anomalies.

3.  **Why Capping is Linked to the Max Potential Damage (`max_pot_dmg`) from the Lookup Table**:
    *   **Absolute Physical Replacement Envelope**: The physical exposure model (FIAT) defines the absolute replacement value of a building footprint (structure + contents) as `max_pot_dmg`. Linking the capping constraints to this value ensures that a building's property value (which can decline if the household becomes impoverished) is bounded above by its real-world physical replacement value.
    *   **Anchoring Economic Agents to Physical Scale**: The cognitive agent engine (DYNAMO-M) must evaluate adaptation decisions (e.g., dry-proofing loan cost payments) relative to the household's home scale. Linking `property_value` capping to `max_pot_dmg` anchors the agent's financial parameters to the building footprint size, ensuring that a small cottage does not calculate utilities using a mansion's exposure profile, or vice versa.
    *   **Interpolation Safety Bound**: Linking capping to the lookup table's `max_pot_dmg` prevents numerical errors where a high-inundation event under extreme SLR would otherwise output expected damages that exceed 100% of the building asset's physical value.

### 10.5 Step-by-Step Walkthrough Calculations

#### Year 1: Background Risk and First Flood

##### Step 1: Initialize Risk Perception
- Starting timer: `flood_timer = 10` years (no recent floods, assumed baseline spin-up state).
- **Formulation**:
  `risk_perception = 2.0 * 1.6^(-3.6 * 10) + 0.01 ≈ 0.01`
  `p_perceived = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001`

##### Step 2: Household A (Middle Income) Decision Math
- **Do Nothing**:
  - NPV_flood = 2 * (100,000 + 50,000 - 40,000) = \$220,000
  - NPV_no-flood = 2 * (100,000 + 50,000) = \$300,000
  - **Utility**:
    `EU_do_nothing = (0.001 + 0.0005) * ln(220,000) + (1.0 - 0.001 - 0.0005) * ln(300,000)`
    `EU_do_nothing = 0.0015 * 12.30138 + 0.9985 * 12.61154 ≈ 12.61108`
- **Adapt**:
  - NPV_flood, adapt = 2 * (100,000 + 50,000 - 5,000) - 2,000 = \$288,000
  - NPV_no-flood, adapt = 2 * (100,000 + 50,000) - 2,000 = \$298,000
  - **Utility**:
    `EU_adapt = 0.0015 * ln(288,000) + 0.9985 * ln(298,000)`
    `EU_adapt = 0.0015 * 12.57072 + 0.9985 * 12.60485 ≈ 12.60480`
- **Constraints**:
  - Affordability limit = $50,000 * 0.06 = $3,000. Since loan cost $1,000 <= $3,000, adaptation is affordable.
- **Decision**:
  - EU_do_nothing (12.61108) > EU_adapt (12.60480) => **Do Nothing**.

##### Step 3: Household B (Low Income) Decision Math
- **Constraints**:
  - Affordability limit = $15,000 * 0.06 = $900.
  - Since loan cost $1,000 > $900, the affordability check fails:
    `EU_adapt = -infinity`
- **Decision**:
  - Household B chooses **Do Nothing** (constrained by low income).

##### Step 4: Realized Event & State Updates
- A 10-year flood event occurs.
- **Wealth Updates**:
  - Household A wealth: 100,000 - 40,000 = $60,000.
  - Household B wealth: 30,000 - 20,000 = $10,000.
  - Household C wealth: Experiences $12,000 damage.
- **Flood Timer Update**:
  - Reset `flood_timer = 0` for all agents.

---

#### Year 2: Post-Flood Risk Perception Spike

##### Step 1: Initialize Risk Perception
- Starting timer: `flood_timer = 0` (reset by flood in Year 1).
- **Formulation**:
  `risk_perception = 2.0 * 1.6^(-3.6 * 0) + 0.01 = 2.01`
  `p_perceived = 0.1 * 2.01 = 0.201`

##### Step 2: Household A (Middle Income) Decision Math
- **Do Nothing**:
  - NPV_flood = 2 * (60,000 + 50,000 - 40,000) = \$140,000
  - NPV_no-flood = 2 * (60,000 + 50,000) = \$220,000
  - **Utility**:
    `EU_do_nothing = (0.201 + 0.0005) * ln(140,000) + (1.0 - 0.201 - 0.0005) * ln(220,000)`
    `EU_do_nothing = 0.2015 * 11.84940 + 0.7985 * 12.30138 ≈ 12.21030`
- **Adapt**:
  - NPV_flood, adapt = 2 * (60,000 + 50,000 - 5,000) - 2,000 = \$208,000
  - NPV_no-flood, adapt = 2 * (60,000 + 50,000) - 2,000 = \$218,000
  - **Utility**:
    `EU_adapt = 0.2015 * ln(208,000) + 0.7985 * ln(218,000)`
    `EU_adapt = 0.2015 * 12.24529 + 0.7985 * 12.29225 ≈ 12.28279`
- **Decision**:
  - Since EU_adapt (12.28279) > EU_do_nothing (12.21030) => **Adapt**!
  - Commit state: `is_floodproofed[A] = True`, `time_adapted[A] = 1`.

##### Step 3: Household B (Low Income) Decision Math & Property/Wealth Capping
Before calculating utilities, Household B's parameters are updated to reflect DYNAMO-M's physical constraints:
1. **Wealth Capping**: In DYNAMO-M, property value is capped at wealth to ensure consistency. The baseline property value `max_pot_dmg_B` ($40,000) is read from the Stage-1 NetCDF lookup table, and is capped at Household B's current wealth (W_B = $10,000):
   `property_value_B = min(max_pot_dmg_B, W_B) = min(40,000, 10,000) = \$10,000`
2. **Damage Capping**: Expected damages (interpolated from the lookup table) are capped at this property value:
   - For Do Nothing: Expected damage was \$20,000, which is capped at the property value of \$10,000:
     `D_no_adapt, B = min(20,000, property_value_B) = \$10,000`
   - For Adapt: Expected damage was \$2,500, which is not capped (since it is less than \$10,000):
     `D_adapt, B = min(2,500, 10,000) = \$2,500`
- **Do Nothing**:
  - NPV_flood = 2 * (W_B + Y_B - D_no_adapt, B) = 2 * (10,000 + 15,000 - 10,000) = \$30,000 => y_flood = ln(30,000) ≈ 10.30895
  - NPV_no-flood = 2 * (W_B + Y_B) = 2 * (10,000 + 15,000) = \$50,000 => y_no-flood = ln(50,000) ≈ 10.81978
  - **Utility**:
    `EU_do_nothing = (0.201 + 0.0005) * ln(30,000) + (1.0 - 0.201 - 0.0005) * ln(50,000)`
    `EU_do_nothing = 0.2015 * 10.30895 + 0.7985 * 10.81978 ≈ 10.71685`
- **Adapt**:
  - Affordability limit = \$15,000 * 0.06 = \$900 < \$1,000 => EU_adapt = -infinity.
- **Decision**:
  - EU_adapt = -infinity => **Do Nothing**.

##### Step 4: Realized Event & State Updates
- A second 10-year flood occurs in Year 2.
- **Wealth Updates**:
  - Household A (adapted): read from `floodproof_all_0`. Damage = $5,000. Wealth = 60,000 - 5,000 = $55,000.
  - Household B (unadapted): read from `no_measures`. Damage = $10,000 (capped at the property value of $10,000). Wealth becomes 10,000 - 10,000 = $0 (clipped to 1 during utility calculation).
- **Flood Timer Update**:
  - Reset `flood_timer = 0` for all agents.

---

#### Year 77: Lifespan Expiration & Sequential Re-decision

##### Step 1: Lifespan Reset
- Assume Household A has remained adapted for 75 years, so `time_adapted[A] = 75` years.
- **Formulation**:
  - The bridge checks: expired = (time_adapted >= lifespan_dryproof) => True.
  - The status is reset: `is_floodproofed[A] = False`, `time_adapted[A] = 0`.

##### Step 2: Re-decision
- In Year 77's decision cycle, Household A must recalculate utilities.
- If no flood has occurred recently, its risk perception decays back to the background minimum (0.01). It may choose "Do Nothing" and defer elevating until another flood occurs.
- If sea level rise (SLR) has increased flood frequency or damages significantly, the expected utility of adapting again (using the same lookup strategy `floodproof_all_0`) will exceed doing nothing, and Household A will adapt again.
- This shows the *sequential* nature of adaptation (i.e. rebuilding/re-elevating after lifespan expiration) rather than *cumulative stacking*.


### 10.6 Multi-Event Integration (n_floods ≥ 2)

If the Stage-1 lookup table contains n_floods = 3 events (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, and 10-yr return period events), the integration coordinate logic scales as follows:

#### 1. Sorted Exceedance Probabilities
The actual return period exceedance probabilities are sorted ascending:
`p_actual = [p_100, p_50, p_10] = [0.01, 0.02, 0.1]`
The corresponding perceived probabilities are:
`p_perceived = [p_perceived_100, p_perceived_50, p_perceived_10]`
`where p_perceived_i = p_actual_i * risk_perception`

#### 2. Coordinate Vectors (x and y)
- **x (probabilities)**:
  `x = [0, p_perceived_100, p_perceived_50, p_perceived_10, p_perceived_10 + 0.001, 1.0]`
  *Note*: The +0.001 offset is added to the **last (maximum probability/most frequent) flood event** in the sorted list to mark the transition to the no-flood state. Any probability higher than that (p > p_perceived_10 + 0.001) represents a state where no flood occurs (damage = 0).
- **y (utilities)**:
  `y = [U(NPV_100), U(NPV_100), U(NPV_50), U(NPV_10), U(NPV_no-flood), U(NPV_no-flood)]`

#### 3. Trapezoidal Area Computation
`np.trapz(y, x)` integrates over these segments, partitioning the probability space into discrete damage bands:
- Segment [0, p_perceived_100]: experiencing the catastrophic 100-year flood damage.
- Segment [p_perceived_100, p_perceived_50]: experiencing the 50-year flood damage.
- Segment [p_perceived_50, p_perceived_10]: experiencing the 10-year flood damage.
- Segment [p_perceived_10 + 0.001, 1.0]: experiencing no flood damage.

### 10.7 Wealth Depletion vs. Economic Growth

#### 1. Static Wealth Depletion (Bankruptcy)
If wealth and income remain static while a household experiences repeated floods, wealth will eventually decline to 0 (or negative). This makes the household bankrupt, causing utility calculations to fail (or clip at 1).

For example, in our walkthrough, Household B's wealth falls from $30,000 to -$10,000 after experiencing two consecutive floods. In this state, its utility of do nothing is capped at 1 and the household is bankrupt.

#### 2. Incorporating GDP Growth Projections
To prevent this, DYNAMO-M runs economic growth projections (P2: Economic Growth step) using annual GDP growth rates derived from SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios.
1. **Income Update**:
   `Y_t+1 = Y_t * (1 + g)`
   where g is the SSP-based GDP/income growth rate (e.g. 2% per year).
2. **Wealth Reconstruction**:
   `W_t+1 = Y_t+1 * income_wealth_ratio(percentile)`
   where the ratio is linearly interpolated from the income-wealth percentile mapping:
   `Percentiles: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]`
   `Ratios: [0, 1.06, 4.14, 4.19, 5.24, 6.0]`
This economic growth provides a realistic wealth recovery mechanism that allows agents to offset damages and afford adaptation loans over long periods.

## 11. Summary of Changes Required / Implemented

### New files (all under the `floodadapt_abm/` package)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`floodadapt_abm/coupling_config.py`](../floodadapt_abm/coupling_config.py) | `NetCDFMappingConfig`, `DecisionConfig`, `CouplingConfig` — Python `@dataclass` configuration. All column/dim/attr names and SEU parameters are declared here with documented defaults. No YAML needed. |
| [`floodadapt_abm/_core/dynamo_decision_bridge.py`](../floodadapt_abm/_core/dynamo_decision_bridge.py) | `DynamoDecisionBridge` — ports DYNAMO-M SEU logic (do-nothing + adapt) as a self-contained, DYNAMO-M-import-free module. Includes `_iterate_through_flood`, `_calc_eu_do_nothing`, `_calc_eu_adapt`, and the per-SLR interpolation cache. |
| [`floodadapt_abm/_core/lookup_utils.py`](../floodadapt_abm/_core/lookup_utils.py) | Shared SLR→damage interpolation kernel: `materialize_strategy_cube()`, `interpolate_cube_at_slr()`, `interpolate_damage_at_slr()`. |
| [`floodadapt_abm/simulation_engine.py`](../floodadapt_abm/simulation_engine.py) | `SimulationEngine` — owns time + data (event draw, per-agent state, year loop); `run(..., n_jobs=N)` for bit-identical parallel Monte-Carlo sequences. |
| [`floodadapt_abm/decision_rule.py`](../floodadapt_abm/decision_rule.py) | `DecisionRule` ABC (Strategy Pattern) + `SEURule` / `ThresholdRule`; `clone()` for isolated per-worker rule instances. |
| [`examples_engine/`](../examples_engine/) | Numbered, runnable learning path (`01_quickstart.py` … `06_mesa_native_driving.py`) that supersedes the old single `run_coupled_example.py`. |
| [`tests/`](../tests/) | Full `pytest` suite (**147 tests**) across the bridge, engine, rules, agent state, event utils, live-parity, mesa-native and mesa-native-full drivers. Uses self-contained mock datasets — no real lookup table required. Run via `pytest -q`. |

### Files pending modification (for full MVP integration)
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `abm_simulator.py` | Own/accept a bridge; pass full damage matrices; replace threshold block; add `eu_history`; derive `is_residential` |
| `2_simulate_adaptation.ipynb` | Construct the bridge via `DynamoDecisionBridge(ds=ds, config=CouplingConfig(...))` and wire into `ABMSimulator` |
| `environment.yml` | Ensure `scipy` pinned (currently transitive via `flood-adapt`); `numba` only if `@njit` version desired |

### Unchanged files
| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `setup_lookup_table.py` | Lookup-table creation independent of decision logic — **but** the chosen `EventSet` must satisfy Sec.1.3 (RP set) |
| `1_create_lookup_table.ipynb` | No code change; ensure RP-based `EventSet` |

---

## 12. Validation, Performance, and Reverse Coupling

### 12.1 Validation plan
1. **Degenerate check** — with `risk_perception ≡ 0` no household ever adapts; the adaptive damage history must equal the baseline.
2. **Behaviour vs old rule** — compare adoption curves to the 0.3-threshold rule on the Charleston test case at small `no_seq` (≈10).
3. **Sensitivity** — sweep `risk_aversion ∈ {0.5, 1, 2}` and `risk_perc_max ∈ {1.0, 2.0, 4.0}`; confirm monotonic, plausible responses.
4. **Affordability** — set `adaptation_costs > income × expenditure_cap`; confirm zero adoption (EU_adapt = −∞).
5. **Lifespan** — run > 75 years; confirm a cohort un-adapts and re-decides.

### 12.2 Performance budget
For `n_households ≈ 10⁴`, `no_seq = 100`, `time_steps = 80` → ~8×10⁵ EU
evaluations. Keep `_iterate_through_flood` JIT-compiled (`@njit`). Note the
`no_seq × n_households × time_steps` memory of `damage_history` (×2 for baseline)
and `eu_history` (×2 utilities) — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) memory note.

**Full-scale hot-path optimizations (2026-07-09, PRE.2).** Exercising the real
Charleston table (61,858 objects × 207 events; 57,976 residential agents) showed
that the damage interpolation dominated wall time. Two fixes were landed in
FloodAdapt-ABM (bit-identical results, commit `6f45d6f`):
- **Cube materialize-once + per-SLR cache.** The residential strategy cube is
  built in NumPy once (masking on the lazily-backed xarray cube was the real
  cost: ~24 s → ~3.6 s), and `prepare_damage_arrays` is memoised per `(SLR,
  method)`. Since the SLR trajectory repeats across Monte-Carlo sequences, this
  removes `no_seq×` redundant interpolation (~5.5 s → ~1 s per distinct SLR;
  0 s on cache hit). `lookup_utils` now exposes `materialize_strategy_cube()`
  and `interpolate_cube_at_slr()`.
- **Parallel sequences.** `SimulationEngine.run(n_jobs=N)` runs the independent
  sequences across a thread pool of per-worker engine clones sharing a
  pre-warmed, read-only cache (`n_jobs=1` unchanged; parallel is bit-identical
  for deterministic rules; ~1.4× on the real table).

Gate result: `verification/real_table_gate/` → `gate_pass: True`
(4b bit-parity + 4a subset parity on the real table).

### 12.3 Reverse coupling (context, not MVP)
`adaptation_decisions_complete.md` Sec.7 documents how an external flood model can
*feed* DYNAMO-M (`coastal_node.damages`, `damages_dryproof_1m`). The long-term
vision is bidirectional. **This MVP is the opposite direction**: DYNAMO-M acts
as the *decision engine inside* FloodAdapt-ABM. Keep the bridge interface
(`evaluate_decisions`) stable so a future reverse coupling can reuse the same SEU.

### 12.4 Phased Development Roadmap & Go/No-Go Gates

The Strategy-Pattern refactor (Sec.3.8) is delivered in gated phases. **Guiding principle:** unify
the plumbing, keep the decision logic pluggable — but validate the science *before* the big
refactor. The `ThresholdRule` path must never regress existing notebooks.

**Readiness (as of 2026-07-09):** Phases 0–4b, 4b-pre **and 4b-full** are **delivered and
gated**. Phase 1's Sec.12.1 battery passes and the ported SEU matches native DYNAMO-M within
tolerance (worst relative EU error 4.2e-7, tol 1e-4; see Sec.12.1 and
`seu_verification_tests/`). The Strategy-Pattern engine (Phases 2–3), the Phase 4a
live-parity oracle, the Phase 4b mesa-native driver and the **Phase 4b-full native-class
integration** (real honeybees `Model` + native `DecisionModule`) all pass their gates, and
**PRE.2 has been executed on the real Charleston table** (`gate_pass: True`; see Sec.14.4).
Remaining work is Phase 5 (new decision rules) plus optional full-geodata MVP wiring items.

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit criterion (gate) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Green examples + reconciled config | Both demos run; suite passes (now 147 tests) | ✅ done |
| 1 | Validated SEU | Sec.12.1 battery passes; SEU == DYNAMO-M within tol | ✅ done |
| **2** | **Core event + time engine** | **No decision logic left in example scripts; ThresholdRule regression exact** | ✅ done |
| **3** | **SimulationEngine + rules** | **ThresholdRule reproduces legacy output; Sec.12.1 battery re-passes** | ✅ done |
| 4a | Live DYNAMO-M SEU parity (in-MVP) | `calcEU_*` parity within tol; live import optional/guarded | ✅ done |
| 4b | Mesa-native integration (scaffold) | `FloodAdaptSLRModel.step()` drives populations; reproduces `engine.run` bit-for-bit | ✅ done |
| 4b-full | Native-class integration | Real honeybees `Model` + native `DecisionModule`; `run_mesa_native_full == run_mesa_native == engine.run` bit-for-bit | ✅ done |
| PRE.2 | Real-table gate | Full Charleston table: 4b bit-parity + 4a subset parity PASS | ✅ done |
| 5 | Extending decision rules | `calcEU_insure`, migration, government CBA as new rules | ⏳ next |

**Phase 2 — Consolidate event & time logic into the core** (3–4 days). Move Bernoulli event
drawing + `max_events` cap out of the example scripts into a single `SimulationEngine` method,
implementing **RANDOM selection** from the drawn pool (preserves the Monte-Carlo distribution).
Add a native `run()`/`step()` so time progression is owned by the engine, not the demo loop;
derive `INITIAL_YEAR`/`TIME_HORIZON` from FloodAdapt SLR projection metadata. Harden
`read_impacts_dataset` with an explicit `object_id`-indexed accessor + alignment assertions.
**Gate (hard stop):** capture a pre-refactor baseline, then confirm `ThresholdRule` damage
histories match bit-for-bit (`rtol=1e-6`) before starting Phase 3.

**Phase 3 — Unified SimulationEngine + DecisionRule (Strategy)** (4–5 days). Introduce
`SimulationEngine`, `AgentState`, and the `DecisionRule` ABC (Sec.3.8). Refactor `ThresholdRule` and
`SEURule` onto the interface; keep `ABMSimulator` and `DynamoDecisionBridge` as thin
backwards-compatible wrappers so no notebook API breaks. Add `eu_history` and `is_residential` to
engine state. **Implement persistent `time_adapted` tracking and the lifespan-dryproof reset**
(Phase-1 V5 gap): native DYNAMO-M resets `adapt=0` when floodproofing age reaches
`lifespan_dryproof` (default 75 y, `coastal_nodes.py:2221–2227`); the current bridge hard-codes
`time_adapted=0` (`dynamo_decision_bridge.py:326`) so adaptation is permanent. Add
`lifespan_dryproof` to `DecisionConfig`, increment `time_adapted` yearly for adapted agents, and
in `should_adapt` compute `reset_mask = time_adapted >= lifespan_dryproof` to un-adapt and
re-decide. **Gate (hard stop):** re-run the full Sec.12.1 V1–V6 battery on the new engine — all must
pass (no science regression) — and confirm `2_simulate_adaptation.ipynb` runs unchanged.

**Risk gates summary.** Both phase boundaries are **hard stops**: if the Phase-2 `ThresholdRule`
regression or the Phase-3 Sec.12.1 battery fails, halt and debug within that phase before proceeding.
Keep a `pre_phase3_baseline` snapshot so any regression can be diffed quickly. Full task
breakdown, dependency graph, and resource estimates: see the 20260708 roadmap doc and
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) "SEU Decision Science Validation & Test Configurations".

## 14. Implementation Notes (Added 2026-06-26)

### 14.1 Configuration Paradigm: Python `@dataclass` (not YAML)

All coupling parameters are declared in **`coupling_config.py`** using three Python
`@dataclass` classes:

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `NetCDFMappingConfig` | Maps logical names to actual dimension/variable/attribute names in the xarray Dataset. Override if your site uses different column names. |
| `DecisionConfig` | All SEU behavioural parameters with DYNAMO-M defaults. Supports any site by overriding individual fields. |
| `CouplingConfig` | Top-level container combining both configs plus `random_seed`. |

**Why dataclasses?** Compared to YAML:
- Strong IDE type hints and autocompletion
- Compile-time validation of field types
- Version-controlled alongside the code with clear provenance
- Trivially composable in Python test fixtures

Example override:
```python
from coupling_config import CouplingConfig, DecisionConfig, NetCDFMappingConfig

cfg = CouplingConfig(
    netcdf=NetCDFMappingConfig(residential_substring="COM"),  # select commercial
    decision=DecisionConfig(risk_aversion=2.0),               # higher risk aversion
    random_seed=0,
)
```

### 14.2 Repository Placement

All new files reside in the **`FloodAdapt-ABM`** repository — not in DYNAMO-M:

```

DYNAMO-M is an **upstream dependency** whose mathematical logic has been ported
into `_core/dynamo_decision_bridge.py`. DYNAMO-M's Python source is **not imported**
at runtime for the ported MVP path — this keeps FloodAdapt-ABM self-contained and
avoids the `gravity_models` import chain in `decision_module.py`. (Phase 4a's
`dynamo_live_rule.py` optionally imports native DYNAMO-M as a *parity oracle* only,
behind a guarded/optional dependency.)

### 14.3 Charleston Lookup Table — Confirmed Dataset Schema

The implementation was validated against:
`C:\repos\DYNAMO-M\lookup_table_charleston_beta_release_ABM_probabilistic_set.nc`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `object_id` dimension | 61,858 total buildings |
| Buildings with `'RES'` in type | 57,976 (≈ 94%) |
| `slr` coordinate | `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]` feet |
| `strategy` coordinate | `['no_measures', 'floodproof_all_0']` |
| `event` coordinate | 207 events (`event_0000` … `event_0206`) |
| `max_pot_dmg` attribute | on `object_id` coordinate |
| `freq` attribute | on `event` coordinate |
| `primary_object_type` attribute | on `object_id` coordinate |

The substring-based residential filter captures both `'RES'` and mixed types
such as `'COM_RES'` via `np.char.find(types, 'RES') >= 0`.

### 14.4 Verification Results

**Unit tests** (self-contained mock datasets, no lookup table required):
```
pytest -q
# ===== 147 passed =====
```

Test coverage includes:
- `NetCDFMappingConfig` / `DecisionConfig` defaults and overrides
- Residential substring filtering (pure, mixed, and custom types)
- Property capping (`damage <= max_pot_dmg` always)
- Wealth and income derivation consistency
- Loan-amortisation formula (including zero-interest edge case)
- Risk-perception update formula (flood timer increment/reset, decay)
- `_iterate_through_flood` output shape and NPV ordering
- `_calc_eu_do_nothing` (adapted agents → −∞, log-utility σ=1, higher damage → lower EU)
- `_calc_eu_adapt` (unaffordable → −∞, high-risk scenario prefers adapt)
- Full `evaluate_decisions` flow (irreversibility, no double-adaptation, error handling)
- Strategy Pattern (`SEURule` ↔ `ThresholdRule` swap), `AgentState`, event draw/cap
- Phase 4a live DYNAMO-M parity (`DynamoLiveRule`, guarded), Phase 4b mesa-native
  driving (`FloodAdaptSLRModel.step()` reproduces `engine.run` bit-for-bit), and
  Phase 4b-full native-class integration (`run_mesa_native_full` reproduces
  `run_mesa_native == engine.run` bit-for-bit under the real honeybees `Model`)
- **Engine performance contract**: per-SLR interpolation cache bit-parity vs fresh
  compute, cache-reuse (distinct-SLR count), and `n_jobs>1` parallel sequences
  bit-identical to sequential for deterministic rules (SEURule + ThresholdRule),
  with no parent-state mutation

**Full-scale gate (PRE.2).** The real Charleston table
(`lookup_table_charleston_beta_release_ABM_probabilistic_set.nc`; 61,858 objects ×
207 events; 57,976 residential agents) was exercised end-to-end via
`verification/real_table_gate/`:
```
gate_pass: True
phase4b_bit_parity_real_table:        True   # engine.run == mesa-native, bit-for-bit
phase4a_parity_real_table_subset:     True   # ported SEURule == native DYNAMO-M (subset)
```
Wall time (3 sequences × 30 years): parallel run A ≈ 73.7 s, mesa run B ≈ 119.4 s,
per-tick mean ≈ 2.62 s — after the Sec.12.2 interpolation-cache + `n_jobs` speedups
(per-tick interpolation ~5.5 s → ~1 s; first cube materialize ~24 s → ~3.6 s;
parallel ≈ 1.4× and bit-identical).

## 11. Implementation Details

### Income-to-Wealth Ratio Derivation

In DYNAMO-M, household wealth is derived from income using a percentile-based multiplier curve defined in `decision_module.py` (lines 27–30):

```python
perc = np.array([0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100])   # income distribution percentile
ratio = np.array([0, 1.06, 4.14, 4.19, 5.24, 6])  # wealth / income multiplier
```

This creates a 101-element interpolated array mapping each income percentile (0–100) to a wealth/income multiplier. The bridge simplifies this to a single configurable value via `DecisionConfig.income_to_wealth_ratio` (default `4.14`, the 40th percentile).

Source: `C:\repos\DYNAMO-M\DYNAMO-M\decision_module.py`, lines 27–30.

### Ex-ante vs. Ex-post Damage Evaluation

The simulation distinguishes between two fundamentally different uses of the event catalog:

| Concept | Purpose | Which Events? | When? |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Ex-post Realized Damage** | Physical: what actually hits the agent | Only the 0–3 events stochastically drawn this year | During the year loop |
| **Ex-ante Expected Utility** | Cognitive: how the agent perceives their future risk to make a decision | ALL events in the probability distribution | At the decision moment |

**Ex-post (Realized):** Each year, the simulation stochastically draws a small number of events (0, 1, or 2) via independent Bernoulli trials. The agent suffers only the damage from those specific events, and their wealth is reduced accordingly.

**Ex-ante (Decision):** When the agent makes a decision to adapt, they evaluate their risk over the entire probability distribution. They don't know which event will hit, so they integrate their utility over the probabilities of ALL possible events (`p_floods`) in the lookup table. This integration over the full exceedance curve is the core of the Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) framework from DYNAMO-M. The integration is performed over a `decision_horizon` (default 15 years) using the time-discounted NPV formula.

### Event Drawing Approach

The bridge adopts FloodAdapt-ABM's independent Bernoulli trials approach for stochastic event generation. For each event in the catalog, an independent Bernoulli trial is performed with `probability = min(frequency, 1.0)`. Multiple events can co-occur in the same year.

This differs from DYNAMO-M's original `stochastic_flood` function (`flood_risk.py`, line 583), which uses a single random draw and allows at most one flood event per year.

The maximum number of events per year is configurable via `DecisionConfig.max_events_per_year` (default `3`). When the stochastic draw yields more events than the cap, the list is truncated to the highest-frequency (most probable) events.

**Configuration example:**
```python
from coupling_config import CouplingConfig, DecisionConfig

# Default: max 3 events per year
config = CouplingConfig()

# Custom: allow up to 5 events per year
config = CouplingConfig(
    decision=DecisionConfig(max_events_per_year=5)
)
```

### SLR Trajectory Source

In production use, the SLR trajectory must be obtained from FloodAdapt's projection database via `fa.interp_slr(slr_scenario=..., year=t)`. The bridge's `prepare_damage_arrays(slr_value)` accepts a scalar SLR value for each simulation year — the trajectory source is the caller's responsibility.

The lookup table's `slr` coordinate contains discrete pre-computed SLR values (grid points for interpolation), not the trajectory itself.

### Risk Perception Initialization

Risk perception is a deterministic decay function of `flood_timer` (years since the last flood), not randomly initialized. The formula from DYNAMO-M (`flood_risk.py`, line 650–651, and `settings.yml`, lines 26–30):

```
risk_perc = risk_perc_max × 1.6^(risk_perc_coef × flood_timer) + risk_perc_min
```

Default parameters (from Tierolf et al., 2023, Section 2.2):
- `base = 1.6` (exponential decay base)
- `min = 0.01` (minimum perception after long time without flood)
- `max = 2.0` (maximum perception immediately after flood)
- `coef = -3.6` (decay rate)

By initializing `flood_timer = 99`, the formula evaluates to essentially `risk_perc_min` (baseline minimum risk perception). When a flood occurs, `flood_timer` resets to `0`, and risk perception spikes to `risk_perc_max`.
